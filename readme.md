## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of identifying similar features between frames in aerial video sequences. Using event cameras, we will track these features to implement structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithms, allowing for accurate object pose estimation and 3D structure reconstruction.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal is to create a model that can identify and track features between video frames captured by event cameras. This will enable the construction of accurate 3D models and object poses, enhancing mapping and navigation capabilities for aerial imagery.
